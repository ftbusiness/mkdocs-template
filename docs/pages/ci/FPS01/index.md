# Catalog Import

The tool lets you list the catalogs from all your systems and import them to [Fiori Tracker Core](https://help.fioritracker.org/2020/#/core/SPS02/main) for documentation purposes (stored as so-called "To-be" records). Catalog Import uses free ["As-is" API](https://help.fioritracker.org/2020/#/asis/FPS01/main).
